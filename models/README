# trankit model

Included are scripts for training a model (and, for releases, pretrained
models) for [trankit](https://github.com/nlp-uoregon/trankit). The model performs
sentence segmentation, tokenization, lemmatization, and part-of-speech tagging,
morphological analysis and dependency parsing.

## How to get trankit

`trankit` can be installed with `pip` for python3.8. Other versions may work,
but we didn't test them.

1. Set up a virtual environment:

```
virtualenv -p python3.8 trankit-py3.8
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
```
source trankit-py3.8/bin/activate
```

3. Install trankit
```
pip install trankit
```

## How to train

With the virtual environment activated, from the `models` directory, run:

```
python train.py he_iahltwiki-ud.trankit
```

Training may take some time!

## How to parse

For raw text, run:

```
python parse.py he_iahltwiki-ud.trankit TEXTFILE > CONLLUFILE
```

For sentences which are pre-segmented:

```
python parse.py --presegmented he_iahltwiki-ud.trankit SENTENCEFILE > CONLLUFILE
```
